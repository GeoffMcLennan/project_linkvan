Hi Friend,

You have a new activation request from <%=@user.name%>!

Contact Name: <%= @message.name %>

Phone Number: <%= @message.phone %>

Email: <%= @user.email %>

Message: "<%= @message.content %>"

---------------------------------------------------------------

Please follow up with <%= @message.name %> to verify the account. To create an account, please click the "Add New Facility" link at the bottom of the home page after logging in as admin. Don't forget to ask the following questions regarding "Resources":

1. Are pets allowed?
2. Is ID required?
3. Are shopping carts allowed?
4. Is WiFi available?

Please forward the Resources answers to me at ktanyag@gmail.com. Also, just let me know which facility (or facilities) to give the new user control over. I'll link the user account to the facility directly through the database. In the near future (I promise), I'll build the tools to allow the admin to do this in the app. 

If you run into any bugs, just shoot me an email.

Aw yea.
